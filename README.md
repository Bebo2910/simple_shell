# Simple Shell Project
As part of my curriculum activities in ALX to practically apply learning outcomes, I undertook a Shell Project to stimulate a basic Unix-like command-line shell.
## Shell Functionality
Designed and implemented a user-friendly command-line interface with features including command parsing, execution, and output redirection.
## Built-in Commands
Developed a set of custom-built shell commands to handle joint operations, such as directory navigation, file manipulation, and process management.
## Error Handling 
Implemented robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle various exceptional scenarios and provide informative error messages.
